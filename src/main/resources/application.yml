#   For security reasons, browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources residing outside the current origin. For example,
#   as you’re checking your bank account in one tab, you could have the evil.com website in another tab.
#   The scripts from evil.com shouldn’t be able to make AJAX requests to your bank API (withdrawing money from your
#   account!) using your credentials.
#   Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that allows you to specify
#   in a flexible way what kind of cross domain requests are authorized, instead of using some less secured and less
#   powerful hacks like IFrame or JSONP.
